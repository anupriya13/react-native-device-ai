# Windows Solution File Created

The missing `DeviceAIFabric.sln` file has been created for the React Native Device AI Windows TurboModule project.

## What was created:
- **Location**: `windows/DeviceAIFabric.sln`
- **Project Referenced**: `DeviceAIFabric\DeviceAIFabric.vcxproj`
- **Build Configurations**: Debug/Release for x86, x64, and ARM64 platforms
- **Visual Studio Compatibility**: Version 17+ (Visual Studio 2022)

## Why the .sln file was missing:
- React Native Windows 0.79.0 deprecated the `react-native-windows-init` tool
- The tool only supports React Native Windows â‰¤ 0.75
- For React Native Windows 0.79+, solution files need to be created manually

## What you can now do:
1. **Open in Visual Studio**: Double-click `DeviceAIFabric.sln` to open the project
2. **Build the TurboModule**: Use Visual Studio or MSBuild to compile the C++ code
3. **Debug**: Set breakpoints and debug the native Windows implementation
4. **Deploy**: Build for release and integrate with React Native apps

## Build Commands:
```bash
# From windows directory
msbuild DeviceAIFabric.sln /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
msbuild DeviceAIFabric.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
```

The solution file follows the React Native Windows 0.79 cpp-lib template structure and should work with Visual Studio 2022 for Windows development.
