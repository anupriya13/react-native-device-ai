# React Native 0.79 Windows Setup Guide

## Important Notice

The error you encountered is due to React Native 0.79 using a different Windows initialization process. The `react-native-windows-init` tool only supports versions ≤ 0.75.

## The Issue

```bash
react-native-windows-init only supports react-native-windows <= 0.75
```

## Solution for React Native 0.79

For React Native 0.79, Microsoft changed the Windows project setup approach. Here are the correct methods:

### Method 1: Manual Windows Project Setup (Recommended)

The Windows project structure already exists in this repository at `windows/DeviceAIFabric/`. To complete the setup:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Open Visual Studio Solution:**
```bash
start windows/DeviceAIFabric.sln
```

3. **Build in Visual Studio:**
   - Open the solution file in Visual Studio 2022
   - Select x64 Debug configuration
   - Build → Build Solution

### Method 2: Using React Native CLI (When Available)

The new approach uses the standard React Native CLI with Windows platform support:

```bash
npx react-native init YourApp --template react-native-windows
```

However, for existing projects, the manual approach (Method 1) is preferred.

### Method 3: Template Generation (Future)

Microsoft is working on new template generators for React Native 0.79+. Check the [official documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/getting-started) for updates.

## Current Project Status

✅ **Already Configured:**
- Windows TurboModule implementation at `windows/DeviceAIFabric/`
- Visual Studio solution file (`.sln`)
- Codegen structure with `NativeDeviceAISpec.g.h`
- Package.json Windows configuration

✅ **Ready to Use:**
```bash
# Test the functionality without Windows app
npm run test           # Run test suite
node standalone-demo.js # Quick demo

# Or build in Visual Studio
start windows/DeviceAIFabric.sln
```

## Why the Error Occurred

The command you ran:
```bash
npx react-native-windows-init --projectType lib --language cpp --namespace ReactNativeDeviceAI --overwrite
```

Failed because:
1. `react-native-windows-init` doesn't support RN 0.79
2. The initialization tools haven't been updated yet
3. React Native 0.79 uses a different Windows architecture

## Recommendation

Use the existing Windows project structure - it's already properly configured for React Native 0.79 with TurboModule support. No re-initialization needed!
