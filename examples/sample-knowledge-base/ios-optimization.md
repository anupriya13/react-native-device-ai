# iOS Performance Optimization Guide

## Memory Management

### Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)
iOS uses ARC to automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation. This helps prevent memory leaks but developers should still be mindful of retain cycles.

### Tips for Better Performance:

#### App Management
1. **Close unused apps**: Double-tap home button (or swipe up on newer devices) and swipe up on apps to close them
2. **Restart device**: Hold power + volume buttons, then slide to power off. Restart to clear memory
3. **Update iOS**: Settings > General > Software Update - newer versions often include performance improvements
4. **Storage management**: Settings > General > iPhone Storage - keep at least 10% free space

#### Background Activities
- **Background App Refresh**: Settings > General > Background App Refresh - disable for apps that don't need real-time updates
- **Location Services**: Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services - disable for apps that don't require location
- **Push Notifications**: Settings > Notifications - disable unnecessary notifications to reduce background processing

## Battery Optimization

### Low Power Mode
Enable when battery drops below 20% for extended usage. This mode:
- Reduces mail fetch
- Disables background app refresh
- Limits visual effects
- Reduces performance to extend battery life

### Battery Health
- **Check battery health**: Settings > Battery > Battery Health & Charging
- **Replace if needed**: Consider replacement if maximum capacity is below 80%
- **Avoid extreme temperatures**: Keep device between 0째 and 35째 C (32째 to 95째 F)

### Charging Best Practices
- Use original or certified chargers
- Avoid charging overnight regularly
- Don't let battery completely drain frequently
- Remove case if device gets warm while charging

## Storage Optimization

### iCloud Storage
- **Photos**: Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > Photos - enable "Optimize iPhone Storage"
- **Documents**: Use iCloud Drive to sync documents across devices
- **Backups**: Regular iCloud backups to prevent data loss

### Local Storage Management
- **Offload unused apps**: Settings > General > iPhone Storage > Offload Unused Apps
- **Review large files**: Check Downloads, Photos, and Videos for large files
- **Clear cache**: Some apps accumulate cache data that can be cleared by reinstalling

## Network Performance

### Wi-Fi Optimization
- **Forget and reconnect**: Settings > Wi-Fi > [Network] > Forget This Network
- **Reset network settings**: Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset > Reset Network Settings
- **Use 5GHz when available**: Faster than 2.4GHz networks

### Cellular Data
- **Check signal strength**: Ensure good cellular coverage
- **Carrier settings**: Settings > General > About - update carrier settings when prompted
- **Data usage**: Settings > Cellular - monitor and limit data usage for specific apps

## App-Specific Optimizations

### Safari
- **Clear history and data**: Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data
- **Disable JavaScript**: Settings > Safari > Advanced > JavaScript (only if experiencing issues)
- **Block pop-ups**: Settings > Safari > Block Pop-ups

### Photos
- **Optimize storage**: Settings > Photos > Optimize iPhone Storage
- **Review shared albums**: Remove unnecessary shared photo streams
- **Delete duplicates**: Use third-party apps or manual review to remove duplicate photos

### Mail
- **Reduce fetch frequency**: Settings > Mail > Accounts > Fetch New Data
- **Delete old emails**: Regularly clean up email accounts
- **Disable push for unnecessary accounts**: Use fetch instead of push for non-critical accounts
